# Password Generator <h1>

[Git Hub Pages Link](https://brigab.github.io/password-index.html/)

This application was created for the purpose of generating secure passwords depending
on a users preference in length and character type. Users are asked five questions via alerts: 

- How long they would like their passwords to be (between 8-128) (prompt)
- If they would like it to include special characters (confirm)
- If they would like it to include numbers (confirm)
- If they would like it to include upper case letters (confirm)
- If they would like it to include lower case letters (confirm)


Given the length entered by a user and whether or not they want to include each of the character types a password is generated. If the user does not select one of the options an alert will prompt them to select at least one and go through the options again. 

Using math random the computer is randomly picking characters from each array and then continually doing so until length has been met. Once length has been met the final password is created which will up in the text box above the Generate Password button. 

Once the password is in the text area the user can then click the Copy to Clipboard button and paste the password wherever they'd like.
