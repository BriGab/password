# Password Generator <h1>

[Git Hub Pages Link](https://brigab.github.io/password-index.html/)

This application was created for the purpose of generating secure passwords depending
on a users preference in length and character type. Users are asked five questions via alerts: 

- How long they would like their passwords to be (between 8-128) (prompt)
- If they would like it to include special characters (confirm)
- If they would like it to include numbers (confirm)
- If they would like it to include upper case letters (confirm)
- If they would like it to include lower case letters (confirm)


Given the length entered by a user and whether or not they want to include each of the character types a password is generated. 

Using math random the computer is randomly picking characters from each array and then continually doing so until length has been met. Once length has been met the final password is created which will show as an alert to the user. 

The password is also stored in session storage and I am continuing to work on getting that final password to also show up in the output box. I would like to get the text to appear in this box before copying to the clipboard since it would make much more sense for a user to click that button if text was there. 

This assignment definitley helped with my understanding of functions and how to start thinking logically about each step and the flow of information.
